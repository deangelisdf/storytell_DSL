Storytell_DSL is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) based on TextX designed to streamline the creation of visual novels and text-based adventure games.
This language is a proof-of-concept of usage of TextX to compose a DSL.

## Features
Script Definition: Define scripts with actors and dialogue sections.
Dynamic Characters: Add actors and assign them roles effortlessly.
Branching Logic: Incorporate if, elif, and else statements to create branching storylines and player choices.
Expressions and Calculations: Use complex expressions and conditions for dynamic storytelling.
Readable Syntax: Intuitive grammar structure that resembles natural storytelling formats.
Comments: Add comments for clarity and collaboration during development.

## Syntax Overview


## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```console
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/storytell_dsl.git
